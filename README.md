# RetroFontForChiliFramework
Adds Retro Font to the Chili Framework

Just add the RetroContent.h file to your Chili Framework application and away you go.
This currently allows you to write text to the screen using the DrawString function:
- Capital Letters ONLY
- Numbers (0 to 9)
- spaces
Do not add any other type of text

Call the function by adding "RetroContent::DrawString(...)" to your code.

Updates to follow:
- Support for more text characters
- Other functions to make your life easier
