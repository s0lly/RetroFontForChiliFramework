# RetroFontForChiliFramework
Adds Retro Font to the Chili Framework

Just add the RetroContent.h file to your Chili Framework application and away you go.

This file requires the later versions of the Chili Framework that include Vec2.h

This currently allows you to write text to the screen using the DrawString function:
- Capital Letters ONLY
- Numbers (0 to 9)
- Spaces

Valid string example: "WELCOME TO GAME123"

Do not add any other type of text

Call the function by adding "RetroContent::DrawString(...)" to your code.

Updates to follow:
- Support for more text characters
- Other functions to make your life easier

Enjoy!
